Everybody, welcome back. Today, we start beginning to talk about the early beginnings of Christianity,
0:01
particularly as it sets a framework for we wouldn't be discussing world religion as a category itself.
0:08
And so doing thinking about the beginnings of early Christianity, thinking about what goes into the category of religion itself.
0:16
Are some of the experiences or ideas fomented here in this particular context go a long way in actually determining what the
0:24
category is and what the category is not in the usage of religion as an analytical category in the study of religious studies.
0:33
So thinking about the beginnings of Christianity today, really about identity and context,
0:42
the importance of context is something you'll hear over and over and over again.
0:48
We're taking this idea from the primacy of belief,
0:54
thinking about belief as a defining element of certain religious identities and indeed in Christianity that become very clear and apparent.
0:58
The Nicene Creed and Credo, as we'll talk about, we have talked about already credo,
1:08
but how it defines certain religious identities in a way and indeed maybe isn't as important in other religious identities.
1:15
But the traction that belief gets as a defining feature of religion has everything to do with its role in understanding Christianity.
1:24
So the question then becomes which beliefs, which beliefs define certain religious identities,
1:35
which beliefs are OK with beliefs are understood to be somehow not OK?
1:42
And what does actually oking mean in this kind of context?
1:47
So what we have here in the beginnings of Christianity is establishing the vocabulary for identifying Christianity and later interactions.
1:52
So this is the trajectory of our course as it will go on.
2:03
We'll also talk about Buddhism as a world religion going to new religious context.
2:07
But Christianity and Buddhism, when reality, Christianity and its different forms and Buddhism,
2:11
its different forms will be the trajectory will be following. So think about how it interacts with other religious contexts.
2:17
And so the goal for today is to establish the context and understand the figure of Christ, bring the Christ and Christianity, if you'd like,
2:24
where it comes from and how that relates then to the concerns and immediate context of early
2:33
Christian communities with an eye toward what happens a little bit later and the codification,
2:40
if you'd like, in. Yeah, codification of what Christianity becomes as a religion.
2:48
And a little bit later on in the Emperor Constantine, which will be the subject of the next discussion.
2:55
Let's take a look at putting the Christ, if you will, in Christianity, the cardinal right off the bat that Christ, it's not a name, but a title.
3:02
So you won't find Christ on the letter box of Jesus's house, for example.
3:13
It's a title given to him and it's in that title that this whole kind of comes together.
3:18
What is Christ? Well, it comes from the word Christ, comes from the Greek word Christo's, which is a Greek translation of a Hebrew word messiah.
3:24
So Christ is messiah through Greek translation.
3:36
So what is Messiah?
3:43
That to understand what Christ is and its role in understanding Christianity with understand the Hebrew tradition from which the idea messiah comes.
3:44
And so it's indeed the case that Jesus, who gives the title Christ, comes from the same Hebraic tradition.
3:54
Jesus was Jewish, his immediate followers were Jewish, and they were understanding what Jesus was doing,
4:02
what Jesus was saying, understanding who Jesus was from the perspective of this Hebraic tradition.
4:09
So the concept that form around understanding Christ as it becomes in English come out of this particular world view.
4:17
And that world view, among other things, is defined by the covenant with God, by the figure Abraham.
4:26
So Abraham has a contract with his God,
4:33
and this contract is basically an agreement that Abraham and his descendants will do certain things and God will look after them,
4:37
the expectation that God will look after them. And so this covenant, this contract is recorded in something called the Torah,
4:47
and it's understood to be revelation in the sense that it's revealed by God to human.
4:55
To Moses, an important figure in this narrative, and this is the narrative that Jesus understands in his upbringing and those immediately around him,
5:01
part of that also is not just narrative in the abstract,
5:11
but it plays the body plays a role in this religious tradition as well, particularly for young men of circumcision.
5:15
Does it say kind of foreskin around the penis is the mark of the covenant?
5:24
So I tend to find as a member of this Hebraic tradition,
5:29
as a way of saying you're part of this contract between Abraham and Abraham's descendants and Abraham Abraham's God,
5:35
and you have the bodily practice of marking that on one's body in the form of circumcision that says you identify as this particular community.
5:45
And this is exactly the community that Jesus grew up in.
5:56
So to understand the story of Jesus, really to understand the idea of Jesus Christ, you have to understand what Musayev means in Jesus's own context.
6:01
And here you get the word messiah, meaning someone who was anointed the anointed one.
6:13
That's what Messiah means. Anointed one. Excuse me.
6:20
So what does it mean to be anointed in this context?
6:25
Well, someone who is going to the anointed one as someone who is expected to deliver the Hebrews, the people of Jesus, Jesus,
6:30
people at the time, descendants of Abraham, Moses and stuff, so Jesus included as the Hebrews from political oppression.
6:42
And this has been historically a problem where Babylonians and Egyptians are now at the time of Jesus Roman political oppression,
6:49
basically controlling the social livelihoods of these people.
6:58
So anointed one actually comes from the idea of a coronation ceremony for the Jordanian king, King David,
7:04
back in 9th century BCE, where the King David was anointed as king and his oil was ritually put on his body.
7:15
As we anointing that's what Messiah means, one who has been anointed as a political leader, as a military leader, as a king.
7:26
And indeed, it was the religious authority at the time of King David who was doing the anointing.
7:34
In other words, suggests that there is a important distinction between religious and military political authority.
7:40
And so the expectation of the Messiah is in this idea of anointed one,
7:48
in this idea of a political military king who would deliver the Hebrews from political oppression.
7:55
And so this waiting for this, longing for this, expecting this figure to come and overthrow the Babylonians or the Egyptians or the time of Jesus,
8:02
the Romans comes out of this sense of a messianic expectation that there was a culturally relevant understanding that there should be someone coming.
8:13
We're waiting for them and they're going to fulfill a particular role.
8:26
Messianic expectation is that of a political leader who can overthrow the oppressive government.
8:30
And so this idea of messianic expectation, the want,
8:37
the hope and the indeed expectation that it's going to happen was present since the time of after the time of King David becomes very fervent,
8:41
kind of ebbs and flows in the history. But because is quite fervent at the time of Jesus and where Jesus is growing up,
8:51
where everyone in what is known as Roman Palestine is awaiting the overthrow of Roman rule,
8:58
it's going to happen any time the Messiah is going to arrive and will overthrow these political oppressors.
9:05
He will be this great military king and as a result, reestablish the kingdom of Judea independent state for the Hebrews.
9:11
So this is what Messiah means. This is the messianic expectation.
9:20
This is the role of a military leader.
9:24
To lead the troops is really, really an affront of many people's mind.
9:31
Is the topic of the day under the oppressive rule,
9:38
the Romans in the region where Jesus grows up and this messiah becomes translating decrees those who get the word Christ Jesus Christ.
9:41
So you have to understand Jesus Christ is how do you understand Jesus as the Messiah comes out of this context, as we will see.
9:51
I mean, the defining feature. So how does authority work in Roman Palestine?
10:02
This is a time when Jesus was around. So he was born in a very volatile time.
10:07
Politically, the area in the immediate surroundings occupied by Rome, the city of Jerusalem,
10:13
was the political and cultural center of the region, occupied by Rome.
10:21
It was the provincial capital for the Roman authorities there.
10:25
And as a result, the ultimate authority, political and otherwise, was held by Rome.
10:29
And any authority other than Caesar's necessarily poses a threat to Caesar's authority.
10:38
This is the way the Romans operated throughout their entire empire.
10:45
This would include religious authority.
10:50
However, interestingly enough, in this region, religious authority was still granted to the Hebrews, to people living there under Roman occupation.
10:54
Why? Well, it has to do with one's own cultural sense of antiquity and how much they appreciate it and sensibilities for it.
11:05
So Rome being fully aware of the cultural heritage they inherited from ancient Greece,
11:16
understands things that are old, things that are particularly written down, old texts, old languages.
11:22
As powerful as worthy of keeping and so the Romans understood the Hebraic tradition and culture with their religion, with their tax,
11:30
the Torah, among others, as being at least as old as the Greek culture from which Rome understands itself being born.
11:42
And so most practical since the Hebrew God must be quite powerful if it's lasted this long.
11:51
It's nothing new, nothing flash in the pan. And so under the careful watch of Roman authority,
11:57
the Hebrews were allowed to keep their own religious authority so long as the Hebrew priests would ask their God,
12:06
their powerful God to pray, or at least to help out Caesar.
12:14
They pray for Caesar to their God. They're allowed to worship the way they want to in their own institutions so they don't have to tear them all down.
12:18
But you still have to give homage to Caesar in those moments.
12:27
So it leads this very you can imagine times of quite tension.
12:31
Who actually is the authority here? Who gets to see how things go?
12:37
And so there is this tension between a religious authority, the Hebrews,
12:42
and the political religious authority, Caesar, as a god of the Romans at this time.
12:46
But should there ever be any question, really, Rome has ultimate control and makes all the ultimate decisions, there's this constant tension.
12:54
It boils over to disastrous results for the Hebrews and seven DCE after Jesus, but resulting in the destruction of the main temple in Jerusalem.
13:03
A bunch of zealots want to overthrow Rome. Messianic expectation in Roman military authority responds by tearing down the temple.
13:18
All except one wall. Which remains today.
13:29
So this is the kind of political, sociopolitical religious environment in which Jesus will be operating and his followers,
13:33
as well as this question of Jesus as Messiah begins to arise.
13:41
Jesus Christ. So what is a religious context in Palestine?
13:47
Well, Judaism as a term really oversimplifies things.
13:52
It's much more complex and dynamic than that.
13:56
And there are indeed many active sects within this larger religious context, some of them working in concert with each other,
13:58
some of them very much oppositional within what comes to be called overlayed this word Judaism.
14:08
But you have, for example, dissatisfies who are known as the priests,
14:14
and they hold the religious authority, the institution of the temple, before it's destroyed in 70.
14:18
So at the time of Jesus, that temple in Jerusalem is the kind of main institutional piece of religious authority held by the Hebrews.
14:25
And it was the services, the priests who controlled it.
14:33
And so as there were lots of tension over control, then you had other groups such as the Pharisees,
14:36
who will be more like teachers, will become rabbis.
14:42
And they believe, among other things, everybody should have access to the Torah, not only just determined by the priest, negotiated by the priests,
14:45
but everyone should be able to read it and communicate through it in the threat
14:54
necessarily of that was a threat to the authority and position of the society.
14:59
So lots of tension even within something. Just Judaism doesn't really cover it.
15:03
Then you have the zealots who are politically motivated, religious group actively against Roman rule,
15:08
and it will be their doings that will cause Rome to react later in 70 to tear down the temple.
15:16
And what you have in this context within Judaism, which doesn't really work here as a term, there's many different sects,
15:25
many different concerns, many different tensions, many different expectations and ideas and responses.
15:33
The dynamism of this is such that there's lots of space for a messianic figures to arise and gain popularity.
15:41
The messianic expectation is particularly heightened at this time,
15:49
and so different figures will arise in different degrees for different parts of this community.
15:54
Fulfill the idea of who the Messiah will be.
16:02
So you have yes, you're by yourself, Jesus, son of Joseph.
16:06
You have after Jesus, long after Jews have summoned Barak or Seeb other messianic figures before and since keep coming up in this context.
16:11
One of them, identified as Jesus, is understood by some to be Messiah and others,
16:21
as we'll see, not to be the Messiah, but how one understands Jesus as Messiah.
16:26
Jesus Christ is exactly that which defines Christianity as something distinct, which,
16:32
as we will see initially becomes quite a problem for those who are following understand themselves to be different identities and context.
16:38
You have this tension over Roman occupation really ruling the day this messianic expectation is really heightened.
16:49
And as a result of that, the Roman authorities know what they're doing.
16:58
They understand the area and they are on high alert.
17:03
They're very tense to enter into this context that we get the figure of Jesus who likely is a Pharisee,
17:08
a teacher becomes like a rabbi who's going around talking to people about how the meek shall inherit the earth.
17:16
And we're establishing a whole new kingdom.
17:25
And all of this kind of rhetoric really speaks to the expectation of overthrowing that political oppressor and the political oppressor.
17:28
Rome hears of it and is very tense. And so this really fuels the narrative.
17:37
So what is the narrative? Well, how do we know about Jesus?
17:43
It's a very complicated question for our class to be thinking about from two different lenses,
17:48
one from sources outside the tradition versus outside the Christian tradition and those within the tradition and the sources,
17:52
the main sources within the tradition will understand who Jesus is, what Jesus did.
18:00
Jesus said, for example, would be the Bible.
18:05
Outside the tradition, you have things like historical records, contemporaneous records, archeological evidence, contemporaneous accounts,
18:09
other writers talking about what's happening at a time and reading things, including the Bible,
18:19
through the lens of textual history and textual analysis, understanding the kind of historical context.
18:25
Which was there to produce something like the Bible.
18:31
So this really kind of summed up in what you might call the historical approach
18:37
for learning about Jesus in the time that Jesus was around his context.
18:41
Now, from within the tradition, you have the Bible and it's broken into from the Christian perspective,
18:47
the Hebrew Bible or perhaps the Old Testament, which is from the Hebrew context itself.
18:54
This is stories that Jesus would be familiar with, narrative that Jesus knew and was well versed in.
18:59
It seems the kind of stuff that would make a Pharisee would an educated, Pharisee educated.
19:06
And then you have the New Testament, the New Testament accounts of Jesus himself written by his followers.
19:13
That's how it works.
19:21
And the main parts of those are known as the four gospels, or the good news written by as a tradition holds Mark, Matthew, Luke and John.
19:22
Here's a picture of them, the four gospel writers.
19:33
And it is this account from within the New Testament that the Christian traditions hold this authoritative.
19:37
This is the authority of what Jesus said and did know historically from the historical approach, the not understood.
19:46
The Gospels are not understood to be firsthand accounts. The earliest gospel writing was assumed to be somewhere around circa seven DCE,
19:53
so around 40 years or so after Jesus's passing, and that at least the generation,
20:03
generation and a half perhaps were not necessarily firsthand accounts, historically speaking, in not necessarily a single writer either.
20:11
But from within their tradition,
20:21
you get the story of who Jesus is in the New Testament becomes an important source for Christians who become Christians,
20:22
early followers of Jesus who were Jewish. But then once Christianity starts to turn to understand what it is that Jesus said
20:32
did not understand Jesus as the Messiah mean things you find in the New Testament,
20:42
mean themes in this Kingdom of God and this new kingdom that Jesus seems to
20:50
be talking about that's really got the Romans worried is the kingdom of God.
20:56
And perhaps it's the most prominent teaching of Jesus you find throughout the New Testament and on its base what the Kingdom of God is.
21:00
Jesus talks about in the New Testament suggests that redemption, this this overthrow,
21:09
all this is coming back and reestablishing the kingdom of Judea, this messianic expectation.
21:14
Well, that will happen, but it won't happen in a lifetime.
21:20
It will happen not in this life, but in the afterlife.
21:25
And so for Jesus, the kingdom of God, as it gets taught and recorded in the record in the New Testament,
21:31
is concerned with something that religious studies scholars call soteriology.
21:38
You see the underlined and in bold there. It's a technical term that gets applied many other religious context besides Christianity.
21:44
But the idea this in some ways the salvation of the soul.
21:52
But it's not a political kingdom that Jesus is talking about in a separate kingdom, in the afterlife.
21:55
But, you know, that might be a nuance difference that's lost on the political authorities who are very,
22:01
very nervous by any kind of messianic talk and overthrow.
22:06
And so, as Jesus describes the body, as it were, is ruled by Rome, one soul is ruled by God.
22:11
And there you have in that implicit assumption that there is a distinction between a body and soul,
22:18
and indeed one will be in the afterlife and the other will not perhaps or maybe will be,
22:26
but a different kind of form, but nonetheless an assumption of separation of body and soul.
22:31
And this becomes an important point of later folks, early Christians,
22:36
but later than when Jesus was around trying to figure exactly who Jesus is and was, what is Jesus's body, what is Jesus or what's a relationship.
22:43
How do you understand that in the context of Jesus, as Christ, as Jesus, as Messiah?
22:53
So it becomes really important. But the separation of the two is something that is already familiar with Jesus in his immediate followers,
22:59
because this idea is actually something that exists and pervades the Hebraic context at large.
23:06
The key point, of course, in all this is that the kingdom of God is coming.
23:13
So thinking about kingdoms in context, remember, this is a highly volatile religio political scene in Jerusalem,
23:20
lots of tension over authority about who has control.
23:29
The religious authority is a dangerously close to undermining Cesar's authority and power in the region.
23:33
There's all this talk and hubbub about someone coming.
23:40
The Messiah will come as a political leader to overthrow. Right.
23:44
And now you've got this notion of kingdom of God being spread around, describing the ultimate authority as God, not Caesar.
23:48
So that's already a challenge to Caesar's authority, the everlasting soul, as it gets talked about as God's reign, not Caesar's.
23:59
God has the power, not Caesar, to grant salvation. This is all sounding quite dangerous, the Roman authorities.
24:06
And so body and soul as separate. The idea that there is a difference comes out of this Hebraic context.
24:13
This is something which makes sense to Jesus and those around him.
24:20
So Jewish soteriology, salvation, right. Describes the afterlife in terms of a separation of body and soul,
24:24
but an eventual reunification of the two body and soul come back at the end of time, the body and funerary rites at the time.
24:32
And today, Jewish custom is placed in the ground. The soul is understood to rise up to be with God.
24:41
And in the end, salvation comes and is seen as the body being resurrected and reunited with the soul.
24:48
Again, this sets up a lot of concern and questions about how to understand Jesus's body and the questions that swirl around understanding
24:57
Jesus as messiahs is where it's coming out of why people are concerned with such things and so concept of salvation,
25:07
often in the context of the afterlife. The important thing here is that the body is not necessarily bad.
25:15
It's not set up as bad here as it will later seem to gain that connotation.
25:22
Or at least body is worse than spirit. It's not bad.
25:27
It's just under the jurisdiction of Rome. The real authority for Jesus is God, though, not Rome.
25:31
And so you might see in the early teachings of Jesus and the idea of the Kingdom of God starting to lean toward the spirit,
25:38
the soul being somehow privileged, and the questions of what makes a body, a body becoming really complicated early on.
25:47
And it becomes the thing that really concerns early Christian thinkers right from the beginning.
25:56
OK. So I know all this thing about the Roman point of view, what happens next, political unrest in the territory of Palestine.
26:03
They've granted Rome has granted religious authority to locals,
26:15
but that religious authority seems even at the unrest as their local religious authorities begin to undermine Roman authority,
26:19
particularly as this talk of a messianic expectation heightens not just because of Jesus, but other figures as well.
26:28
At the time, rabble rousers are getting very, very excited, and Roman authority understands this long held tradition of messianic expectations.
26:35
So they're very much keeping a very watchful eye on what's developing here.
26:44
So Ron Roman authorities get word that there's this guy going around talking about
26:52
a new kingdom that's going to supersede the power of Caesar and the power of Rome.
26:57
You hear a little whispers of messiah from some folks talking about him, but he doesn't look like a military figure.
27:02
He doesn't look like a political king charging in front of an army to overthrow.
27:11
People are starting to talk now. It's Passover. Passover, is it now Jewish Hebrew holiday of celebrating the escape from Egypt?
27:18
As I say that people going for overthrowing, running away from bondage,
27:31
overthrowing bondage with the help of God from a political oppressor, the Egyptians.
27:37
This is the story of Passover.
27:41
The story of Exodus is a story identified community story of overcoming severe political oppression with the power of their God.
27:43
And this is a story that gets told ritually every year at Passover. So it's really something that the Romans are a bit uneasy with.
27:58
People are necessarily coming into the capital of Jerusalem from all over the region to celebrate this important holiday.
28:05
So lots of new faces showing up from all over. There's this guy keeps talking about a new kingdom.
28:13
Things are getting tense.
28:20
And at Passover, Jesus will celebrate what will be his last meal, his last supper with his closest followers, a Passover meal.
28:21
Very tense time and so what happens?
28:34
Well, Roman authorities come and arrest Jesus, they bring him before Caesar's represented representative in the region,
28:38
Pontius Pilate and other religious leaders of local authority,
28:46
pilot sentence Jesus to death by crucifixion, which is a particularly Roman way of executing prisoners,
28:50
as opposed to, for example, a Hebraic way in the region. We would be stoning to death.
29:01
But this is how Rome had been doing and would continue to do it throughout their empire and particularly to this figure of Jesus.
29:06
The Roman authorities add insult to injury by stripping him, mocking him by placing a crown of thorns as though he were the Messiah.
29:14
The King anointed with crown of thorns, though, and posting a placard over his particular cross eye and or eye.
29:24
Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.
29:34
This is the Messiah, which doesn't really fit the bill as a political leader and from the Roman perspective, wasn't very successful.
29:38
So what happens next is the story of Christianity.
29:49
Has it do tell a story in many, many different ways to focus on, again, the question of how to understand Jesus as Messiah,
29:57
how to understand putting the Christ and Christianity for the media followers is a bit problematic.
30:09
This idea of kingdom king of the Jews, Jesus does not fit the conventional description for the Messiah is not a political leader.
30:19
He's not a warrior. He's not a military strategist who overthrowing the oppression of the Romans.
30:29
He's not even talking about overthrowing Roman occupation at all.
30:39
He's talking about in the afterlife, a new kingdom.
30:43
And so for many who might have heard Jesus talking about the kingdom of God just simply doesn't fit the bill of what a messiah would be.
30:47
And there are many other alternatives at the time and since and before him as well.
31:00
And indeed, to put up underline finer point on all this, Roman was not overthrown.
31:07
In fact, things got much worse about 40 years after at 70 to see the temple itself was destroyed.
31:15
So this new kingdom, when's it going to come?
31:21
This isn't really fulfilling what was expected in the general idea of what a messianic expectation would provide.
31:25
So for those who believed Jesus to be the Messiah.
31:34
To make sense of all of this, the notion of messiah would have to change.
31:40
And that becomes at least the way that we'll be talking about this class,
31:47
that becomes what makes Christianity distinct, putting the Christ and Christianity,
31:52
if you would, is changing the need to change the idea of what messiah actually entails from the expectation Hebraic context to something different.
31:57
And it's in that difference that we find Christianity.
32:08
And we also find it to be really the main concern of all those immediate followers in the wake of Jesus being crucified, what to do now?
32:13
So speaking of Jesus as the Messiah, understanding Jesus as the Messiah,
32:22
how do his followers understand Jesus as the Messiah becomes the crucial question for
32:28
those immediate 12 folks who would follow him do later become known as the 12 apostles.
32:36
So as the Messiah, to understand him as such, Jesus necessarily represents a break from the tradition and as a result of that,
32:44
make those who follow him different breaking from the tradition.
32:53
In the beginning, this didn't cause so much of a problem from the outside as much as it was a concern of what to do now in the absence of our leader.
32:58
But as this begins to gain traction, this notion of being different as a break from tradition becomes really a problem for Rome.
33:08
So another problem more immediate than that is that Jesus is preaching that the kingdom of God was coming soon and indeed the immediate
33:19
followers this world would follow round come to come to be called the 12 apostles seem to have expected to come within their lifetime.
33:29
And now Jesus is gone and the kingdom hasn't come yet.
33:38
And it's making people concerned. And so as the New Testament, the there to the New Testament tells it, from within their traditions perspective,
33:43
students to the apostles were inspired by what comes to be known as the Holy Spirit.
33:57
During the celebration, the Pentecost the Pentecost is a calendrical holiday to celebrate 50 days after Passover,
34:02
to celebrate Moses receiving the Torah from Moses as God.
34:12
It is in this moment gathering the 12 apostles to 50 or so days after the crucifixion of Jesus, not knowing what's happening.
34:16
What happened to the idea of the messianic expectation that kingdom of God, there's no leadership.
34:28
They get together the Pentecost and there they get inspired by the Holy Spirit to go out and talk about Jesus to people again.
34:33
Boldon as New Testament will tell it, especially the two most prominent members,
34:44
Peter and James of these apostles will go out and basically spread the word of Jesus.
34:50
But what are they spreading when they spread the word?
34:55
Well, what they're concerned with, it seems, is not so much what Jesus said and did, but spreading the word of who Jesus was, in other words,
35:00
being emboldened by the Holy Spirit as it comes be called in a New Testament at the Pentecost following Jesus's crucifixion to
35:13
go out and spread the word of Jesus here is to tell people how he actually was the fulfillment of that messianic expectation.
35:21
The primary primary concern here is how to explain him as the Messiah.
35:31
So not about what he talked about what he did, but who he was.
35:37
Again, how to understand and what comes to be called Christ, Christ and Christianity.
35:42
So as the Messiah, what does that mean?
35:48
Well, Jesus as the Messiah must be understood within the context of the New Testament, as someone who suffered lacross for all of mankind,
35:51
all of humankind, someone who was resurrected after three days and ascended to the kingdom of God that's been promised.
36:02
But we'll come back down and bring that kingdom of God to every.
36:13
This is how Jesus in the narrative of Jesus gets understood from the perspective of his 12 closest followers as described in the narrative,
36:23
the New Testament, How Jesus is the Messiah. This is how he fits the messianic expectation there.
36:34
Messianic expectation suffered on the cross. Dynes was resurrected, ascends to the kingdom of God.
36:41
The Kingdom of God is still coming.
36:49
Now, this promises, should it gain traction and, you know, spoiler alert it does this promises to become something distinct.
36:54
It's a different way of understanding what Messiah is. And as a result of the different way of understanding Jesus as messiah,
37:08
as something different out of this Hebraic context, it comes the concept comes out of the Hebrew context.
37:16
The worldview comes out of the Hebrew context, the word messiah. Right.
37:22
And Jesus himself and all those 12 apostles are coming directly out of a hybrid context for focusing on the question
37:26
of how to understand Jesus as Messiah will be that which leads outside of that context and becomes Christianity.
37:34
And so it's not there that Christianity begins. It's where the direct the trajectory starts to change.
37:41
And it actually is in the figure of someone named Paul might say that the beginning of Christianity really gets started.
37:48
So Paul is credited with being among the first to really talk about Jesus outside of that initial Hebraic context,
37:58
where it's not a question of what is a messiah, it's a question of how do you understand Jesus as the Messiah now?
38:06
And the figure of Paul will be trying to explain the whole concept of messiah to a different audience altogether
38:13
who's never heard of the word look like crystals and their sources for understanding within their tradition.
38:20
What Paul does is called acts as well as letters that he will be writing.
38:27
So who is Paul to understand him in the New Testament? He's actually his name is Saul.
38:32
He was among a group of Pharisees teachers who actively rallied against the followers of Jesus, initially saying that they're misunderstanding things.
38:38
He actually participates in the stoning of theirs or Hebraic context of executing somebody,
38:49
stoning what we call the first Christian martyr named Steven, a martyr, someone who was killed as a result of their beliefs.
38:57
That becomes an important theme. So he participates in that activity and then he falls off his horse, as it were.
39:04
And gets visited by a vision of Jesus, an end result of that moment becomes a follower of Jesus and becomes really
39:15
adamant follower of Jesus and become probably one the most important figures,
39:23
if not the most important figure after Jesus in Christianity. Indeed, it is Paul who is credit for being the first Christian theologian that is,
39:27
who's putting it together, trying to investigate how to understand the relationship between Jesus.
39:37
The idea of massiah, the idea of kingdom of God, the idea of God,
39:47
of Abraham's God into how all of these pieces fit together or don't, and how to make sense of those relationships.
39:54
Paul's really concerned with this. This is the this is the endeavor of theology.
40:04
So such Paul's could have been a theologian. But Soccio, historically speaking,
40:09
what really makes Paul so important is that he is credited with being the first to bring the idea of Jesus, the Messiah, to.
40:15
The Greeks and it's in that Greek context that the beginnings of Christianity really
40:25
get started and the trajectory goes away from the Hebraic context into something new,
40:31
and that's exactly what I pick up on. Next time I see that.
40:38

Hello, everybody, and welcome back. Religious studies one on one today we're continuing our discussion of the early beginnings of Christianity.
0:01
And if you remember last time we were together,
0:09
we talked about the Hebraic context out of which the question of messiah arises and becomes messiah, becoming Christ in the Greek.
0:12
Christo's trying to figure out how to put the Christ in Jesus Christ.
0:21
The question of what constitutes Christ,
0:25
how to understand Jesus as this messianic figure is exactly that which occupies much of the early Christians and early followers.
0:28
Indeed, before Christianity really split off from the Hebraic context.
0:36
The main concern of most of the immediate followers of Jesus is going to pick up that thread.
0:40
If you remember, we ended up talking about the question of what constitutes Christianity and gotten there.
0:47
Yet did becoming Christianity as a social movement really starts with the figure of Paul?
0:54
This is a slide we're all familiar with from last time. But here, bring your attention to the bottom of there,
1:00
where not only is Paul credited with being one of the first Christian theologians trying to understand the relationship between what is Jesus,
1:07
what is Messiah, what is this kingdom of God that Jesus has been talking about?
1:15
And how does it relate to the expectation usually follows the idea of a messiah, a messianic figure.
1:20
It is someone within the Hebraic context, at least, is expected to be a political leader.
1:27
Overthrowing the oppressive rule of the reigning government is exactly the kind of thing that made the Roman authorities nervous.
1:32
But here, as the Romans were responsible for crucifying Jesus, executing him and indeed mocking him as king of the Jews,
1:40
that messianic expectation was not fulfilled in the same way as it is generally perceived by convention.
1:50
In the Hebraic context, Jesus was not a military figure,
1:55
and though he was talking about a new kingdom to come, we're talking about coming in the afterlife, perhaps.
2:00
And so for the immediate followers, the question is, OK, what do we do now?
2:07
Lost the kind of central figure of Jesus as an authority that Dorottya to voice on what it is that Jesus says and does,
2:12
of course, and also the prominence. The kingdom hasn't arrived yet.
2:18
Rome is still in power. So he injured. This picture comes Paul, and he brings the idea of what Jesus is, the understanding,
2:23
the question of trying to figure out how Jesus figures as the Messiah,
2:32
as the idea of Messiah, must have to change a little bit, seeing how the figure of Jesus doesn't fit that mold.
2:36
Well, he brings this idea of Jesus and indeed the idea messiah itself,
2:43
to some degree to a broader context outside of the Hebraic context and in among the greater Mediterranean world,
2:47
can occupy and dominated by Greek culture to here.
2:54
Do you find your first real big split community wise individuals who are outside of
2:59
the Cypriot context now learning about what it means to understand Jesus as messiah?
3:04
Or in this particular case, Christo's the Greek word for a messiah we now talk in English about as Christ.
3:11
So really what we're talking about today is the becoming of Christianity,
3:20
the split out from a Hebraic context and the conditions that make sense in every context,
3:24
talking about messianic expectation into a new cultural setting, the cultural settings between Hebraic and Greek cultural settings.
3:31
I mean, they're not very distinct in the sense that this has been a lot of mixing and matching is very Kosma Cosmopolitan place,
3:39
as you can see here, map kind of tracing the route that Paul would take all over the Mediterranean world.
3:46
So there's no question that Greek context and those living in the Greek speaking world are familiar with the Hebraic context and vice versa.
3:54
No question that the question then becomes how does Paul present this figure of Jesus as a messianic figure in a way that not only makes sense,
4:02
but somehow,
4:14
as we know, gained traction in the Greek speaking world such that Jesus Christ becomes a figure when the Christ prenda Christo's actually in Christ.
4:15
So when Paul goes outside Hebraic context into the larger Mediterranean world, he finds quite a receptive audience.
4:27
There already been lots of interest in Hebraic ideas among the people he feels he finds.
4:35
But certain things would get in the way, particularly you might remember from last time,
4:41
the idea of entering in this covenant, this contract Abraham does with his God did all of his descendants.
4:46
This contract requires a mark on the body. It's not much just to save doing.
4:53
You have to show that you're part of it. You have to do something, and this was in the case of circumcision, cutting the foreskin off a penis.
4:58
Well, the ideas espoused in Abraham was talking about later figures like Moses and the like,
5:07
the things we find in the Hebrew Bible got a lot of interest,
5:15
but never got a lot of traction necessarily among people in the Greek speaking world and around the Mediterranean.
5:19
One of the big reasons is because the idea of circumcision, particularly for older male adults,
5:24
it was very much a stumbling block to actually go through that process.
5:30
And so Paul found in his understanding of Jesus as the Messiah and how it relates to this particularly
5:35
identifiable practice in a practice that identifies someone as a member of this community,
5:43
not so much a belief in this case, but a practice circumcision.
5:49
Or Paul argues that since the rules that govern the covenant between Abraham and Abraham's God and all of Abraham's
5:52
descendants were in place based on the expectation that God would deliver Abraham and his people a messiah.
6:04
Well, if Jesus is the Messiah from Paul's perspective, then that contract has been fulfilled.
6:13
And as a result, for all the rules of that contract at that covenant, no longer need apply.
6:21
So since the Messiah had come for Paul Jesus, the rules only to apply.
6:27
So then you don't need to get circumcised anymore. And likewise, dietary rules and other kinds of rules that would govern,
6:32
practice daily life no longer need to be followed because frankly, that contract has been fulfilled.
6:39
Now, a new contract, if you'd like,
6:46
and testament will be opened up in the expectation of Jesus coming back as a messianic figure once again when the kingdom eventually comes.
6:49
Well, Paul has effectively removed many of the practical stumbling blocks that seem to have prevented many folks
7:01
in the Greek speaking world who were already interested in many of the ideas espousing the Hebraic context,
7:10
but felt somehow unable or unwilling to take upon themselves the different practices and rules that are kind of governing that context.
7:18
Well, now those rules and practices no longer need apply. So you can eat what you want.
7:28
Perhaps you don't have to get circumcised and you can still join in this new covenant
7:33
that Paul is espousing based on the arrival of Jesus as the messianic figure.
7:39
Again, how to understand Jesus as Messiah is a key here.
7:44
Ramifications are significant because Christianity now can spread outside this Hebraic context outside the Hebraic world.
7:48
And as a result of that context matters becomes something different.
7:55
So this is the beginnings of Christianity, as it were, moving out of the Hebraic context from a small,
8:02
perhaps minor messianic cult among many other several messianic cults that were happening at the time and since.
8:08
But now, in a different kind of context, taking on different ideas, different concerns, indeed, different vocabularies.
8:17
This is particularly important for our course because this is exactly what we will be doing, looking at Christianity as a world,
8:24
religion, Buddhism as a world, religion, going to different contexts and seeing how the different contexts,
8:30
religious context and cultural context and the like impact the concerns, questions,
8:37
vocabulary's concepts that shape not only Christianity in Buddhism, but how Christianity and Buddhism also shape the surrounding environs.
8:42
So this is exactly what's happening in Christianity, moving out of the Hebraic context and becoming something new.
8:53
But an entirely new. And the popularization of Jesus in this Christian identity,
8:59
what Paul does as a result of Paul's success and proselytizing these communities is
9:05
Christian communities now something different beginning to spring up all around
9:11
the Roman Empire and becomes a bit of a challenge for Paul to not only explain who
9:14
Jesus is as the Messiah or now Jesus as the Christ Christo's to a new audience,
9:22
perhaps from the ground up, if you'd like, conceptually speaking, but also to keep everybody kind of together,
9:31
to get everyone on the same page as he's spreading the word around.
9:37
So he writes many letters, epistles as they come to be known and recorded in the New Testament, at least from within the traditions perspective.
9:40
Socially, historically speaking, these cosmopolitan centers are already well-established cosmopolitan centers around the Mediterranean,
9:49
getting groups of Christian followers just by based on population density.
9:56
So places like Antioch and Jerusalem would be led by figures, apostles like James in Jerusalem,
10:00
places like Alexandria and Egypt, places like Rome, even led by the apostle Peter.
10:09
These leadership positions kind of come to these population centers where groups of Christians would start to develop a community,
10:16
a more stable community now and every community is built.
10:24
The same in Alexandria is different than Rome, which is different in Jerusalem, which is different to Antioch, et cetera, et cetera.
10:28
So it would kind of develop its own flavor and of course, subject to its own time and place, Rome.
10:34
The center of the Roman Empire,
10:41
and so you have to talk about Christianity perhaps as a new thing a little bit differently than you might in a place like Antioch,
10:43
which is a little bit further away from the cultural and political center.
10:49
So as much as it's Christianity, understanding themselves is identifying themselves.
10:53
Indeed, as we'll see as Christian communities, they're not exactly on the same page because they couldn't be.
11:00
So for Paul is very successful. And this idea of spreading Christianity outside of Hebraic contact is really great for making Christianity popular.
11:08
Right. But it's not particularly great in the political climate at the time when it catches the attention of Rome, the central authority.
11:17
So early leaders like Peter and James would operate within the Hebraic context, within their own context, except Peter actually is in Rome.
11:25
Right. They're going up from the Hebraic context to Rome. Right.
11:36
And in that moment early on, early on, you're talking about, again, within the Hebrew context and a messianic figure, there's many of them.
11:41
You might remember that Rome was allowing Hebraic religious authority to stay in place in Jerusalem because of its appreciation,
11:50
Rome's appreciation for antiquity. So as long as this is some form of that Hebraic religious context,
11:59
then it's still kind of follows falls under the umbrella that Rome is extending to Hebraic religious authority.
12:06
But once it gets to the Greek world, as we've been seeing,
12:15
it significantly changes and is no longer understood to be a sect within the Hebraic context.
12:18
Its Christianity is something new and.
12:24
No one no longer has the kind of protection of being related to or understood from
12:30
Roman perspective as part of an older antiquity tradition like the Hebrew tradition.
12:37
As something new, then it's speaking to different authorities,
12:45
it's speaking on behalf of different authorities, in this case, Jesus, Jesus is God the new kingdom to come.
12:49
And you might remember that any authority, including religious authority that is not Caesar necessarily is a threat to Caesar.
12:57
So by virtue of identifying themselves as something different, distinct from that Hebraic context, that old covenant is finished.
13:06
This is something new. Will those communities now gaining traction in population centers around the Mediterranean or Christian communities?
13:16
Self-identified Roman authorities asked them if they are Hebrews and they say no.
13:28
And this then causes the problem for Rome. This is something new.
13:33
This is a new authority in Rome will not abide any other kind of authority other than Caesar's.
13:37
And so starts Roman persecution of early Christian communities precisely because
13:43
early Christian communities understand themselves to be something different.
13:49
So we have here is really a tough start for Christianity in the beginning.
13:57
Among the many difficulties to really stand up for our purposes.
14:02
For nearly 300 years or so now, starting from this point forward, 300 years forward, rule would actively persecute Christianity in waves.
14:08
Now wasn't constant pressure all the time, sometimes in earnest, sometimes not at all,
14:18
over 300 years and certainly in different places, in different ways.
14:24
Places closer to the Roman capital of Rome will have more influence, you would imagine,
14:28
or actually endure more kind of pressure and tension those in compared to those places further away from the center.
14:34
The second problem is that early Christian communities and then for the next 300 or so years are continually expecting this kingdom of God to arrive.
14:43
The most important teaching, but the most important teachings of Jesus is to have in the New Testament.
14:55
And it hasn't come yet. So enduring all these different forms of troubles, tribulations, indeed, sometimes outright persecution.
15:02
The expectation is messianic expectation of Jesus to come back and usher with him, the new kingdom of God.
15:11
It hasn't come. And if you remember the Jesus immediate followers of Apostle.
15:19
It was their understanding. It seemed that the kingdom was supposed to arrive in their own lifetime and now were more than 300 years past that.
15:25
And things haven't shown up and things actually haven't seemed to be getting worse.
15:31
So under this kind of pressure, this constant pressure,
15:38
leaders of early Christianity really need to find a way to keep Christianity ostensibly together.
15:43
In the meantime, as they await for the kingdom of God to arrive and hear Christianity is plural.
15:51
But it's an excuse me, it's singular you can see here, but it's singular only in kind of an ideal sense of medicines.
15:58
But you really have our individual communities that because of Roman authority and
16:09
how Roman is actually Rome is actually dealing with these communities during times,
16:16
many generations of many generations, different ideas can develop locally among these different Christian population centers.
16:21
So you really have Christianity right from the beginning of all of this.
16:30
But the leadership of these individual communities trying to find ways to kind of keep it a singular thread,
16:36
at least running through all these different communities. So Christian were spread all throughout the empire with very little structure.
16:42
And so in order to try to keep them together, both locally and to the degree that they could,
16:51
and it wasn't always the case, but really that they could go out and kind of interact with other Christian communities.
16:57
They try to establish institutional structures, centers around these communes themselves, these population centers.
17:04
So they develop what you could be considered the church.
17:12
So different population centers had different sized churches, if you like, communities, institutional communities where generations could come and go,
17:15
but people would still identify themselves as Christian and be part of this church community.
17:25
Alexandria's church community was quite large. Rome's church community at times had to be quite small, had to be very careful.
17:31
Also, as Alexandru was a very bustling, cosmopolitan place at a time.
17:41
As you can see here on this map, the Mediterranean world and Western Europe, you see some of the main spots where.
17:47
Christian communities, they become Christian centers, is in the middle there, of course,
17:56
towards the eastern part, you see Constantinople and Chalcedon in Nicaea towards the south east,
18:02
you see Alexandria there in Egypt, out of Egypt and Jerusalem, just to the east of there, Antioch,
18:10
just to north that these are centers of Christian leadership, Christian communities, Christian identities.
18:17
But they necessarily don't share the same identity. They simply can't get there from different parts of the world,
18:25
even perhaps speaking different languages, though presumably everybody spoke Greek and Latin.
18:30
But what happens in Constantinople and Jerusalem is not the same thing that happens in Alexandria,
18:37
which is not the same thing that's happening in Rome. And so what actually defines Christianity singular at this moment?
18:41
Socially speaking, not a whole lot.
18:49
That's really a struggle to figure out what the early leadership of these community centers, how to kind of keep everything together.
18:52
And so the structure of finding these churches found in these churches, institutionalized structures,
19:05
made it easier to keep people together in a way to keep communities together in a way,
19:12
but also made Christians easier to find for the Roman authorities to.
19:19
I think they're more kind of centered or grouped together, more critical mass in these places,
19:26
and so the trouble of keeping everybody together and exacerbating the first problem of persecution,
19:30
should Rome feel somehow like they want to go after Christians today,
19:38
they know where to find them much easier because of this church institutional structure.
19:43
Things really, really tough at the beginning, first few hundred years.
19:48
Meanwhile, all this is happening. People are wondering when is the kingdom going to come?
19:53
But by the end of the third century, Rome had much bigger problems than looking for Christians.
20:01
And this is the sets up, the amazing, amazing transition from Christianity or Christianity,
20:07
these local communities identifying themselves as Christian and as a result of that, becoming the object of great persecution at times, at times not.
20:16
Becoming the religion of the state itself and flipping the script, if you like, can be going from persecuted persecutors, context matters here.
20:28
This is the issue by the time the place has everything to do with how this develops,
20:40
from the fact that Rome is kind of in its dying embers towards the end of the
20:46
third century creates this vacuum that will see to allow for something to emerge.
20:50
And what emerges in this case is Christianity as a state religion.
20:56
Let's see how that happens. So saving Roman Emperor Constantine by the end of the third century, the Roman Empire is indeed crumbling.
21:02
Rome has lost a lot of its central authority as a result of that power vacuum of the central authority weakened
21:15
with the weakening of the central authority creates this power vacuum where warlords start springing up all over.
21:22
What was the Roman Empire? Still ostensibly is.
21:29
But practically speaking, there's a lot more room now for local authorities to rise up and clean rulership of their immediate surroundings.
21:33
So you end up having local warlords going to war with neighboring local warlords to see who can become the bigger warlord.
21:42
And one such warlord is named Constantine.
21:51
There you see his dates and dates.
21:55
Here are mostly a reference point I'm going to ever ask you to memorize dates more about understanding a chronology as part of context,
21:57
how things happen, what in relation to each other. But there is dates.
22:05
And as a war, Lord Constantine, like many other warlords in his time, was having successes and he was having failures.
22:11
He did win some land. He'd lose some land.
22:19
He'd take over a neighboring warlord and their territory and their people, and then he'd lose some territory people.
22:21
Konstantin's also had many different wives from around the empire and one of his wives turned out to be a Christian.
22:30
Now, this becomes really important because. Constantine would go into war asking for the help of a God,
22:39
and there are many different communities, gods around this time in this place, in this, well,
22:48
crumbling empire as regards Constantine as his practice would be before battle would pledge allegiance to a particular God,
22:55
asking for success in battle and pledging that should they have success in battle.
23:05
To dedicate the victory to that God, where the symbol or armor or flag of that God, if you would like,
23:11
and make sure all those who are worshiping that God were protected under his political authority.
23:20
And so in these winnings and losing that Konstantine experiences,
23:28
he eventually gets around to asking one of his wives, the Christian wife, about their God.
23:33
So he says, sure, I will paint the symbol of your God on our shield and ask for victory in battle.
23:40
And like, every time I ask if we get back victory in battle.
23:46
And we'll dedicate the victory to the God who will make sure that anybody worshiping them will be protected under our rule.
23:49
And so that's exactly what he does constantly in preparation for battle paint, a sign of the Christian God,
23:56
the cross and the shields of all his soldiers and the like and the flags and the banners and goes to
24:04
war against a neighboring warlord and wins and then wins and continues to win these pivotal campaigns.
24:09
And as a result, his political influence expands greatly as he wins all this territory.
24:20
And true to his word, true to his pledge. He makes sure that anybody who worships this Christian God under his rule will
24:26
be allowed to do so with his protection and eventually under his territory,
24:34
becomes most of what was eastern part of the whole of the Roman Empire.
24:40
So Constantine saves Rome in a way by becoming the Holy Roman Empire himself.
24:47
He wins and it keeps winning and he ends up unifying more or less.
24:53
What was the empire of Rome? So he crowns himself the Holy Roman emperor, fighting under the banner of the Christian God,
24:57
winning these territories and A.H. allowing all Christians under his rule to
25:08
no longer have to worry about persecution but are not protected by the state.
25:12
And true to his word, in 313, he signed the so-called edict of Milan and as emperor,
25:19
he makes Christianity illegal religion and officially legal religion under his rule, which now expands most of what was the Roman Empire before him.
25:26
So Christianity is officially recognized by the state.
25:38
And this is a really big deal, of course. Right. This is the big moment when the tables get turned, if you'd like.
25:43
But also it's very interesting for us, particularly in our class, we think about the main themes of authority, identity,
25:51
legitimacy, who gets to call something legitimate, who has the authority and how they determine who counts and who doesn't.
25:58
Well, here you are, an example of the state,
26:07
particularly in the form of the Emperor Constantine legitimizing Christianity as a religion under his authority.
26:09
You don't have to agree with Constantine. Of course, you could say Christianity is not legitimate, but then you have to face the wrath of Constantine.
26:19
Right.
26:27
So he has the authority as the emperor of the whininess willingness of all the warlords, if you will, to legitimize Christianity as a state religion.
26:28
This, of course, changes everything for the status of Christians and particularly Christian leadership,
26:38
because not only are the state religion and all these illegal religion, but he makes Christianity the official religion of the state.
26:43
Not necessarily at the exclusion of others,
26:52
but the power now the religious authorities have leading these smaller communities in these population centers become something massive.
26:55
Indeed, they now run the official state religion in all of the power that comes behind all that muscle.
27:05
And so what ends up happening effectively is Christianity, almost relatively speaking overnight in the case of Constantine,
27:14
goes from being persecuted by the state now being the state religion responsible for persecuting others.
27:23
And this Mediterranean world with all these population centers now, they know they not only have the freedom.
27:35
To be Christians, but now they have the power of the state backing them and all these population centers, it's a pretty good deal.
27:45
And the question is, why does Constantine do this? Well, there is some debate when that Constantine himself was Christian.
27:54
It is. The narrative goes at his deathbed he converted to Christianity, was never a self-proclaimed Christian throughout any of this.
28:03
But also we can think about what role does Christianity play as a state religion for Constantine?
28:12
Well, if all of these population centers spread out all throughout the former Roman Empire now trying to establish his own empire, he wins.
28:19
It's one thing to win power. It's another thing to keep in, consolidate it and keep control.
28:31
So by having these population centers spread all throughout his nearly one empire, Constantine can, in a way, help keep tabs on things.
28:36
It certainly helps his political gains and ambitions as well to make Christianity the state religion.
28:46
It's a great way to kind of keep everything together, keep everyone pulling in the same direction, especially because it's still tumultuous times.
28:54
You only just recently became the biggest warlord. Could still be other warlords out there.
29:01
So then, practically speaking, what happens in these communities, in the organization of the church?
29:08
You have churches already before these population centers, but now these churches become, well, part of the state religion.
29:14
So this new found favor empower the institutional structure that was started under the shadow of persecution.
29:23
Now really can develop really strongly strong ties and indeed somehow related to the state institutions as well.
29:30
So these centers of Christian communities become institutional seats of power and authority within the structure of the church,
29:38
the whole idea of the institution now. So these nodes, or I should say these population centers form as nodes become a network.
29:47
That is the church structure. And these centers were called sees as easy as that you see there.
29:55
And hierarchies were granted and established for leaders to oversee these different cities.
30:04
They had the authority of the sea. So the local leadership leading these Christian communities,
30:11
generations and generations and generations now it's becoming more institutionalized, more kind of routinized, if you like.
30:18
And these leaders were granted institutional status now, because this is a bigger,
30:26
bigger thing right here as the Holy Roman Empire, the leaders of these communities, the sea was big enough.
30:31
We're called bishops. So, for example, James is considered the first bishop of Jerusalem, Peter, the first bishop of Rome.
30:40
This is posthumous titles for James and Peter, the actual establishment of bishops as an institution.
30:49
Doesn't happen to hundreds and hundreds of years afterward, James and Peter are there, but kind of looking back anachronistically,
30:57
reading back in the past, James considered the first bishop of Jerusalem, Peter the first bishop of Rome.
31:05
Now, since Rome is the initial set of political and religious power in the empire,
31:11
the bishop of Rome was viewed in terms of that kind of centralized authority.
31:17
This is in the very beginnings of Konstantin's empire, the Holy Roman Empire.
31:22
Rome is still an important place. We'll see in just a moment our shift, but the beginning.
31:27
The bishop of Rome is kind of seen through this lens, both culturally and politically,
31:32
the kind of power that Rome as an idea, as much as it is a place, has over the whole region.
31:38
So the bishop of Rome gets affectionately referred to as papa.
31:46
Father, and this is what becomes the pope, so the pope is simply the bishop of Rome relative to all these other sees at this time,
31:51
the pope is just just like any other bishop in any other seat.
32:01
You will see there are more important population centers that than Rome, particularly early on.
32:06
So the pope doesn't have any particular authority. It's just kind of an affectionate special or reserve that reflects more about
32:12
the kind of ideal of Rome itself and the kind of kind of nostalgic history,
32:19
if you'd like. There has anything to do with the person or the office itself, at least at the beginning.
32:25
Things would change later on.
32:33
But the pope doesn't really stand to be the most powerful figure at all because the capital soon gets moved to Constantinople and 330,
32:37
the city of Constantine and the authority of the pope and many of the other bishops and differences
32:48
gets challenged by the authority of those bishops around in centers around the capital,
32:53
the political and cultural and economic capital of the empire, which is moved to Constantinople.
32:59
But effectively, what you have now here is the freedom to establish this institution, the church and the big C,
33:07
this network and the rules and the structures and the offices and the hierarchies so that as people come and go,
33:15
these positions and structures will remain the same way to kind of routinized the authority of who determines what direction Christianity takes.
33:23
And so have the freedom to establish this institution. And then Constantine very quickly gives people the freedom that you have an established.
33:36
You've got to figure out what does it do to Constantine wants to get all the bishops together and figure out what it means to be Christian.
33:44
So to do this, Constantine brings leadership or representatives of leadership from around the Christian world,
34:00
the Holy Roman Empire, together for a council meeting to talk about what does it mean now to be Christian?
34:09
Because Christine has been developing the better part of 300 plus years separate from each other,
34:18
these different groups are separate, trying to maintain some kind of common thread.
34:25
But is Neron necessarily the same thing being said all the time?
34:28
So what actually does it mean now that we are a Christian state?
34:32
So the purpose of a council or sometimes called the synod this time is really to decide the direction of the church, the institution.
34:37
So the leadership of the institution gets together as a group to agree upon what should the church institution be.
34:48
And so you have.
34:57
In these councils become the place where decisions get made and then presumably those decisions get carried out in the kind of local sees.
34:59
So what you have is the councils really serve as the authority of the institution that is now Christianity.
35:12
The authority may have been Jesus at one point and the authority may have been.
35:21
Paul, what does it mean to be Christian? Well, if Jesus is there, you could ask him, though.
35:25
I wonder if you wouldn't be confused by that question, because Christianity hasn't really developed that way yet.
35:30
Paul, maybe Paul would have something to say. Right, about what it means to be Christian a little bit more.
35:36
But now Paul and Jesus are no longer there. They can't be asked.
35:43
They don't. They are authority. That voice of authority is no longer part of the picture.
35:47
So into that vacuum is the council, the voice of the council, the agreed upon decisions of the institutional leadership that becomes the authority.
35:51
And it's deciding the direction of the church, which is deciding the direction of Christianity itself at this point.
36:02
And as it has been since we started this conversation,
36:11
the fundamental question that everyone wants to understand when they get together at the council, the big thing is understanding.
36:15
How do we understand Jesus as Christ?
36:24
One of the ramifications and effects of all this is establishing that which is considered
36:34
orthodoxy so that what is agreed upon in the council will be considered orthodox.
36:40
That is correct doctrine, but we straight doctrine to correct doctrine that which comes as orthodox and by virtue of that, also to reject heresy.
36:46
The council's job is also to reject more. This is not what we think Christ means as a group, as an institution.
36:56
So those views that are rejected by councils as opposed to accepted by councils, the accepted ones orthodoxy, the rejected ones are heresy,
37:04
unorthodox or perhaps even heterodox teachings that are rejected by the church,
37:13
ideas about who Jesus is and things like this that are not agreed upon.
37:19
Now, heresy at this in this moment, in this particular usage does not necessarily need to imply bad or evil.
37:24
Or misleading anything, it can simply mean that which is not accepted by the council.
37:37
It could still have traction among communities and be OK later on the charge of heresy,
37:44
as we saw with the figure of Peter Martyr, this charge of harassing heretical views becomes something much, much more malicious.
37:50
But here, it just means not really accepted. These ideas are still out there.
38:00
But accepted by the council, the church, so what authority do they have if you don't agree with them?
38:07
What do you do? You know, we'll see that in a second. So to ensure as best you can that these councils have.
38:13
Proper authorities have the ability to make a decision and expect that decision to be carried out with authority,
38:25
proper authority, they have to be agreed upon and they have to be agreed upon by many.
38:32
And so constantly called the ecumenical councils to establish this institutional framework could become something of a technical term.
38:37
The Ecumenical Council, right. Ecumenical really means inhabited.
38:48
And by extension, the idea here kind of ideally is getting idea of the whole inhabited world, everybody.
38:54
So if you call an ecumenical council, you have the whole Christian world present to agree.
39:02
But really, it becomes a technical term for authoritative councils of the Christian leadership to get together and decide about questions of doctrine,
39:09
orthodoxy. So ecumenical councils are the ones the kind of technical term for those councils that
39:19
have the authority to determine the direction of a church to determine what counties,
39:27
orthodox or not, but the councils, of course, themselves, ecumenical councils are only really authoritative and that means here effective.
39:31
If everybody agrees it doesn't work. If half the group says one thing, have the group says the opposite, it's not going to really work.
39:42
You need agreement. And so the emphasis of these ecumenical councils as they function within the church institution of deciding.
39:51
Correct doctrine is the emphasis is placed on gaining a unanimous consent for these decisions,
40:04
practically speaking, unanimous most often meant, mostly agreed upon.
40:12
As we'll see, not everybody agrees all the time, but hardly ever.
40:17
But in that kind of rhetoric of it and the way that authority works and in particular the way
40:23
that councils must work in order to claim the authority to decide what is orthodox or not,
40:29
what direction the church should take or how to understand Jesus as Christ, they have to present a necessarily unanimous ish agreement.
40:39
Otherwise it doesn't work. Everybody agrees.
40:53
This is what we're doing now. Right. So in these first ecumenical councils, we just look at a couple just to give you examples of how this works.
40:56
They're very much concern, as we mentioned before, understanding who Christ is and in these ecumenical councils,
41:11
they wrestle with the questions and ideas of the time of the day.
41:19
And so here is a moment to pause once again and recognize how critical context is for determining how things develop and.
41:24
Was these were these councils held at a different time, a different area, a different place?
41:36
Some of these questions in the way that they're framed might not have ever come up.
41:41
The results might be completely different. What does it give you an example?
41:46
Since the early prevailing thoughts at the time and relate to questions at the time
41:51
of how to understand Jesus Christ and get picked up in these ecumenical councils,
41:56
one such as Gnosticism? No,
42:01
Gnosticism is a general term applied to kind of general prevailing philosophical ideas and a movement
42:05
throughout the Roman Empire and then also the Holy Roman Empire before and after Constantine.
42:13
And it insists on a stark dualism as an idea is not necessarily specific to Christianity or anything else.
42:21
It's just an idea floating around here where the stark dualism with that which is spiritual and immaterial,
42:28
is necessarily good and that which is physical or corporeal, substantive is somehow that.
42:37
And so within prevailing popular Gnostic thought at the time,
42:47
when the ecumenical councils are starting to form up as Constantine is bringing his Christian world
42:51
together and hear that creation itself was an accident because creation is filled with the physical.
42:57
An accent of a lesser create a period. Right.
43:07
So as a lesser creator isn't actually the spirit of creation, it all created things.
43:13
You mean living things? Plants really has the immaterial spirit that which is good is necessarily trapped by the physical ness of the body,
43:18
corporeal body, which from Gnostic perspectives is bad.
43:28
And so the idea of narcissism then is to use knowledge or gnosis.
43:32
To then free the immaterial, good spirit from the bad ness of corporate and physical reality materiality.
43:38
So this is a really popular prevailing idea at the time throughout a cosmopolitan world.
43:50
And it had been for a long time and will continue to be.
43:58
But this is one of the most popular ideas at a time when these countries are being put together.
44:01
And so you have certainly communities of early Christian Gnostics that, as I say,
44:06
the ideas of narcissism as kind of articulated through the lens of understanding Jesus as Christ.
44:11
In that case, Jesus has to be the ultimate good, this figure within Christianity.
44:17
Certainly, therefore, if spirit is good, in body is bad, according to Christian Gnostics, what God would not create the body, right?
44:25
Because God, when anything bad in Jesus is ultimate good.
44:36
So Jesus cannot be bad. Therefore, Jesus must be all spirit and not body.
44:39
And so you can understand Jesus as Christ, Jesus as Messiah to come to deliver this message of pure knowledge,
44:47
pure gnosis as a way to free everybody spirit from the negative, bad, malevolent bonds of the body.
44:56
There is a positive Jesus as our spirit, not body, certainly within the logic of narcissism.
45:07
This would make sense. Could not be human.
45:14
A pure spirit, really popularity at the time.
45:19
An equally popular idea, or perhaps maybe not equally popular,
45:25
but an idea espoused by a powerful popular person by the name of areas areas was a priest,
45:29
a theologian of Alexandria, one of the more prominent, popular and powerful seeds in the Holy Roman Empire.
45:37
And he was very focused on the idea of monotheism, the idea of a singular deity.
45:46
Christianity is a monotheistic religion, at least according to areas.
45:52
And so he's very concerned about how to understand this relationship between Jesus and God, because Jesus refers to God as his father.
45:57
But ideas that Jesus is God's divine son really complicates the issue for him, because for areas,
46:09
it seems like there's ideas to God figures going on here, a Jesus and a God, and cannot both be divine from monotheism to work from areas perspective.
46:16
So in that case, from areas perspective,
46:33
Jesus could not be divine spirit at all because that would suggest two distinct divine spirits, no longer monotheism.
46:36
Therefore, Jesus must only be human. He was created by God and meaning that if he's created by God as a human,
46:44
Jesus was not always present, wasn't ever present, and therefore cannot really be the son of God.
46:54
As understood as God's divine son just doesn't work for monotheism, at least according to areas.
47:01
But who's listening to areas?
47:08
Well, lots of people are missing the areas because areas happen to be a leader, a very, very important part of the Christian world.
47:10
And so because of that, the question that areas arise brings forth in what comes to be called Arianism, his ideas and the question of Gnosticism,
47:18
because it's such an important prevailing idea at the time,
47:31
become the two main things that are brought up to talk about at the first ecumenical council called.
47:35
The first time the Christian leadership world, the whole inhabited world, ecumenical but really Christian leadership around the Holy Roman Empire,
47:43
the first time to get together to discuss what it means to be Christian.
47:51
And it's these two issues that are brought up and kind of taken in the debate in the council.
47:56
Excuse me. Well, that council gets called a place called Nicaea.
48:07
It's the first ecumenical council held in 325 see called by the emperor himself and indeed financed by Emperor Constantine.
48:16
Here is his chance to bring the whole Christian leadership together, to all get together,
48:25
understand what Christianity is, and certainly will help Constantine consolidate his political power,
48:30
while it will also help the institution of the church decide what direction it means to be Christian, how to define Christianity.
48:36
For Christians, this is the first time it happens on such a large scale.
48:47
So the idea is that there's about 318 bishops attending, but likely it's a little bit less than that.
48:54
And the idea is to bring bishops, bishops all over the Roman Empire, former Roman Empire, now the Holy Roman Empire, to bring them all over to Nicea.
49:02
If you can see in the background the map, Nicea is just south of Chalcedon, just so barely east of Constantinople.
49:12
Present day Turkey and the greatest concentration of bishops came from North Africa, Alexandria,
49:23
for example, the most important sea at the time with their most important population centers at that time.
49:31
And that matters, of course, right time and place. So most of the bishops come from North Africa.
49:37
Two priests came as representatives of the bishop of Rome remember bishop of Rome as the pope.
49:44
So the pope, bishop of Rome was not there at the Council of Nicaea, sent representatives in their stead.
49:51
And the whole point, of course, is to discuss the nature of Jesus. How do we understand Jesus as messiah?
49:58
How do you understand Jesus as Christo's?
50:04
And how do you understand Jesus as Christo's through the lens of these two really important ideas, Arianism and Gnosticism.
50:07
The result, if you read the Nicene Creed, is a rejection of Gnosticism and a rejection of Arianism.
50:17
How does it go?
50:27
Well, the Council of Nicea, the result is as the Ecumenical First Ecumenical Council gets called, that understand what does it mean to be Christian?
50:30
And the result is what it means to be Christian is a creed, the Nicene Creed.
50:39
Defining Christian identity based on belief to be Christian.
50:46
This is your creed, this is your belief that which we have agreed upon in our ecumenical council here, our first meeting in Nicaea.
50:54
Accrete, so thinking about the potency of belief as a feature,
51:02
the defining feature of certain religious communities in context here it is laid
51:07
out bare for all of us to see as the critical defining feature of Christianity.
51:12
The first opportunity in the Christian world gets to define what Christianity is for Christians.
51:17
The result is a creed. So three degrees upon a doctrine, orthodox belief for Christianity,
51:22
this is the orthodox view as decided upon in the first quarter of this year, correct doctrine.
51:34
If you do not agree with it, then you are somehow not orthodox and perhaps you cannot be identified even as a Christian.
51:42
So what you have in the details of the Nicene Creed or belief in one God maker of all seen and unseen,
51:51
is an act of conscientious rejection of the Gnosticism and the Gnostic idea that the Creator God is a lesser God.
52:00
It's an accident. No, the God of Christianity is not.
52:11
That is a maker of all things seen and unseen. So it's an act of rejection, narcissism.
52:14
That's what's put in the cream.
52:21
Jesus is both human and divine spirit, rejecting both Arianism that says it can only Jesus can only be human agnosticism,
52:25
saying that Jesus can only be spirit or divine. It's an act of rejection of both now.
52:34
So ideas that Jesus calls substantiations. There's some human and some divine combination in this figure of Jesus and indeed Jesus is to
52:40
be understood as God direct rejection of both Arianism and narcissism for different reasons.
52:51
But this is the claim in the Nicene Creed.
52:59
This is what it means to be Christian for this ecumenical council, the authority deciding what it is to be Christian for Christians.
53:01
Interestingly enough, of course, if narcissism wasn't around or if Arya's didn't care about monotheism the way he did,
53:11
chances are that's not wouldn't it be addressed in the creed you wouldn't have begun, not made as a rejection of Arianism.
53:20
As part of the language of the creed is part of what it means to believe, to be Christian.
53:31
So context is really, really fascinating here.
53:37
The question of context doesn't undermine what the Nicene Creed is, doesn't undermine from within the tradition.
53:40
Faith claims about the power of the Nicene Creed. Certainly not.
53:46
But come have a broader perspective.
53:51
It does point out very clearly how significant time and place and happenstance is in creating something that has been for some at least,
53:53
the tradition kind of taken on its face value as the creed. But it comes from somewhere just out of nowhere.
54:05
The other counts would like to talk about as a car council of Caledonia and the
54:16
reason why we want to talk about the Council of Caledonia Chalcedon excuse me,
54:20
is not not because the particulars of the theological debate in Christological debate that go on there are particularly relevant for a course.
54:25
They're interesting, no doubt.
54:35
But because the Nicene after Nicaea is the first time in the last time that this ecumenical world gets together and ever agrees.
54:37
After Nicaea, many other councils get called to help clarify some of the decisions made in orthodoxy in that first council.
54:47
And you had your first instances of official disagreement and result of official disagreement and these ecumenical councils is split schisms,
54:56
different groups going in different directions now with orthodox Christianity at that point?
55:06
Well, now it becomes different for different groups. Those who agree with the council's decision certainly maintain that orthodoxy,
55:13
those that disagree with the council's decision to continue the way they were with their own communities.
55:20
Well, I certainly don't that certainly don't think the decision of the council's orthodox that is heretical.
55:25
Who is to say and it's always an open question. So the moment that Constantine brings everybody together and Council of Nicaea is
55:32
again the first and last moment that the ecumenical world all agrees after that.
55:40
It becomes Christianities. Chalcedon happens several councils later, several years later, decades, centuries.
55:47
It's called in for 450 one to consider questions of Christology and Christology Christological.
56:00
The still the question is,
56:06
how do we understand Jesus Christ and the relationship now between Jesus Christ and Divine Holy Spirit and indeed expectation of the kingdom to come?
56:08
So trying to figure out, OK, Biga not made, all right, and try to figure out, OK,
56:21
there's some kind of substantiation going on here which Jesus is both human and divine, but how does that work?
56:27
And that really occupies a lot of council thought, trying to figure out the relationship here in Chalcedon between divinity,
56:33
the logo's, if you like, and the humanity of Christ, Jesus Christ,
56:41
the figure of Christ in this council is about 500 to 600 participants coming so much larger,
56:48
but most of them from eastern regions of the empire, with only two representatives now from Africa.
56:56
So even though there's more people, the places from which they're coming is much more concentrated around local kind of geographic centers.
57:03
So ecumenical clearly means something a little bit different here.
57:13
But we have an Council of Chalcedon is the Caledonian creed.
57:19
And again, we're not to unpack the specifics of how the divinity and humanity of Christ get understood in this creed.
57:25
What's significant for us in our class together is that the results of this Caledonian creed and the council itself,
57:33
so the Caledonian creed becomes to be accepted.
57:41
But what in later times would be communities known as Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Anglican and most Protestant communities.
57:46
Now, those categories and labels don't make sense in 451.
57:57
Those categories and labels ways a distinguished distinguishing excuse me,
58:03
different communities and different ideas even happened much, much later through similar kinds of historical circumstances.
58:08
Similar in the sense of the history is different. The context is different.
58:19
But the importance of context and the relationship between context and where things go is the same here.
58:23
So because a specific kind of historically determine factors, you have these different groups much, much, much later.
58:31
But some that are listed here, perhaps because they're more recognizable and are contemporary contemporary context here, North American University.
58:37
So the Caledonian creed is accepted by groups of people.
58:47
Leadership, some of which would split into these different groups we see here,
58:53
the custodian creed at the Council of Chalcedon is rejected by other groups,
58:59
will become the Assyrian Church, Coptic Church, Armenian, Ethiopian churches, among others.
59:05
So you have an example here of a schism, a break. It's not the first time this has happened.
59:12
This is many councils since Nicea, many breaks and divisions have occurred.
59:18
But this was particularly interesting for us because it's rejected by the Assyrian church there and indeed the Assyrian
59:23
church that we will encounter a lot when we start to talk about Christianity in India and in the Indian religious context,
59:30
because the schism of this year in church, their followers were traveled eastward and.
59:38
Continue their practices and their understanding and their ways of defining what Christ is,
59:47
what Christ can be through their own teachings and practices and develop their own networks of communities,
59:52
as we'll see in South Asia as much as in Persia to pick up this thread of the Assyrian church that splits after the Council of Chalcedon.
59:59
But the important thing here to recognize in this moment now is that this is just one of many instances where Christianity as a singular,
1:00:09
doesn't really make much sense. Right, and what?
1:00:19
Is effectively multiple Christianity and continues to be multiple Christianity is interesting is what actually creates those?
1:00:26
Guess what? By what grounds that people draw these lines of identity that no, I'm not with this group anymore.
1:00:35
I'm staying with this group or we're going to split into two different groups because we cannot abide what?
1:00:42
Well, questions of belief.
1:00:49
How do you understand and believe in this particular case, the relationship between the divinity and the humanity of Christ?
1:00:51
How do you believe it? Which one do you believe, the Caledonian Creek?
1:01:00
Or not, and that's a defining moment of identity, of community even.
1:01:06
So where are we going with all this? What then is Christianity?
1:01:13
It's a really interesting question now, right? And what role does belief play in defining Christianity?
1:01:19
But it's more to just belief as a defining feature, I think we've looked at that quite a bit now becomes now a question of who gets to decide.
1:01:28
How do they decide which belief is orthodox, which is heterodox and how those decisions get legitimized,
1:01:39
who has the authority and what results and how people kind of change or determine identity by by a result of all that?
1:01:47
So when you're looking for Christianity, where do you find it?
1:01:57
What does it look like? It looks like many different things, perhaps.
1:02:03
And so the question really we want to ask of ourselves,
1:02:09
something that we could have asked of Henry still Allcott will continue asking ourselves as we now start to shift in a different religious context,
1:02:13
geographical and cultural context as well. What do those who understand religion to be one thing see when they look?
1:02:21
What do they see, do they only see what they're looking for? What do they not see?
1:02:31
And what can come as a surprise for some when things don't meet expectations, what then?
1:02:39
What do we make of it? See if we can't be thinking about these kinds of questions as we move forward in different contexts.
1:02:46
Look forward to it very much. As always, please feel free to let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
1:02:55
See you next time.
